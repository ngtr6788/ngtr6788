## Greetings! 👋 My name is Nguyen Tran.

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- 🔊 How do you pronounce my first name? *ng* as in "si*ng*i*ng*" + *wuh* + *ian*. If you like IPA, whatever that is, here it is [ŋwiəŋ].
- 👨‍🎓 Currently studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. Will graduate in August 2025.
- 👨‍💻 Software-wise and career-wise, I want to explore new things, work in different places. I want *variety*. Still not quite sure what I want to work in yet.
- 🖼 Things I worked on that I'm "proud" of: 
  - [ctk](https://github.com/ngtr6788/ctk), an improved CLI wrapper for Cold Turkey blocker
  - [keycard](https://github.com/ngtr6788/keycard), a flashcard app for keyboard shortcuts (WIP)
  - [Laser Chess](https://github.com/ngtr6788/Laser_Chess_2), my Python implementation of an actual board game called [Laser Chess](https://www.thinkfun.com/products/laser-chess/)
- 📄 Editors I use: VSCode and neovim
- 🤞 Interesting things I'm working on (and hope it works out)
  -  🚧 Continue contributing to [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte)
  -  📎 Hopefully contribute to other projects (e.g. [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst)))
  -  🏫 Survive both school and a part-time job 👷
- ⚡ Fun facts: I sometimes run as a hobby, read some self-help books, and draw. Again, sometimes.
