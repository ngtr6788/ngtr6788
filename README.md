## Greetings! 👋 My name is Nguyen Tran.

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- 🔊 How do you pronounce my first name? *ng* as in "si*ng*i*ng*" + *wuh* + *ian*. If you like IPA, whatever that is, here it is [ŋwiəŋ].
- 👨‍🎓 Currently studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. Will graduate in 2025.
- 👨‍💻 Software-wise and career-wise, I want to explore new things, work in different places. I want *variety*. Still not quite sure what I want to work in yet.
